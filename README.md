# Web front UI for interactive Haskell stack projects

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/hadui-web-front/community](https://badges.gitter.im/hadui-web-front/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/hadui-web-front/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

## Orientation

hadui is data science oriented, it is not suitable as a general purpose
web framework.

All exported functions from all modules in the stack project of matter,
are exposed to frontend in a flat name space. This is ideal to support
analytical workflows, but overly open or even prohibitive to support
business workflows.

## Support (or lack thereof)

Commercial support has not been planned, community is not formed yet,
but hadui is an important part of my internal tool chain at work, it is:

- macOS - regularly used on Mojave
- Linux - regularly used on Ubuntu 18.04
- Windows - should work in Docker in theory, not attempted yet

### GHC and Stack

hadui is geared to run upon the latest
[LTS Haskell](https://www.stackage.org/lts)
supported by Stackage, but currently an experimental version of
[GHC 8.6.5](https://gitlab.haskell.org/complyue/ghc/tree/ghc-8.6-ife)
is necessarily used as the compiler, while it can be automatically
installed by `stack` for macOS and Linux on x64 hardware. You are
encouraged to compile from source if on other platforms or the
automatically installed bindist does not work for you.

The mod to GHC is very light - simply added `:frontend` cmd to allow a
[Frontend plugin](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/extending_ghc.html#frontend-plugins) be used with GHCi mode,
(pending issue at https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/17348) it
should be no difficulty to migrate to other GHC versions. so far an MR to
GHC is thought of but not carried out yet. Until the official stock
release of GHC has it merged, I would be maintaining custom branches
matching the GHC version chosen by latest
[LTS Haskell](https://www.stackage.org/lts) which is `8.6.5` by
[lts 14.11](https://www.stackage.org/lts-14.11)
at time of speaking.

## (My) Typical Usage

> I believe hadui can be useful in more ways for you and others, e.g.

Data analysts use a browser to submit scripts (in native Haskell, for
parameters, simple job control etc.) to trigger number crunching in
the backend (a single Haskell process or a swarm of computing nodes),
and to see results plotted back to the browser - more windows opened
to show [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org) figures (this feature yet
under construction).

Programmers have `hadui-dev` as the default build tool run an ever going
build task in their [HIE](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine)
enabled [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) environment, to develop
crunching code in stack projects.

## Quick Start

- create a stack project with `hadui` as one of its dependencies,
  in its `package.yaml` like:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - base
  - rio

  - hadui
```

- in the project's `stack.yaml`, tell location of hadui within `extra-deps`,
  and customize the compiler definition:

```yaml
extra-deps:
  # to use the version of hadui checked out locally
  #- ../hadui/hadui

  # to use a version of hadui from github
  - github: complyue/hadui
    commit: stable
    subdirs:
      - hadui

compiler-check: match-exact

# CAVEATS
#
#   binary distributions referenced following have NO support, checkout:
#
# https://gitlab.haskell.org/complyue/ghc-ife-bindist/blob/master/README.md

ghc-variant: ife

setup-info:
  ghc:
    macosx-custom-ife:
      8.6.5:
        url: "https://gitlab.haskell.org/complyue/ghc-ife-bindist/raw/master/ghc-8.6.5-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz2"
    linux64-custom-ife:

        url: "https://gitlab.haskell.org/complyue/ghc-ife-bindist/raw/master/ghc-8.6.5-x86_64-unknown-linux.tar.xz"
```

- besides your `stack.yaml`, create `hadui.yaml`, like:

```yaml
# this cfg file 'hadui.yaml' is located by hadui besides
# the nearest 'stack.yaml' up from cwd you run hadui.
# it uses `stack path --project-root` to locate the dir.

# by default, only the local interface is bound to listen
# for hadui ws connections, this hardens the arbitrary
# code execution vulnerability a bit. but for you or your
# collegues to access hadui web front from other machines,
# bind to one of the external interfaces, or simply all
# interfaces by specifying '0.0.0.0'.
bind-interface: 0.0.0.0
http-port: 5050
ws-port: 5051

# backend log level
log-level: DEBUG

# additional options passed to GHCi
ghci-options:
  # max history in trace, GHCi defaults to 50
  - -fghci-hist-size=300

  # run project code compiled, instead of interpreted, for performance
  # but you won't get source locations for uncaught errors at runtime
  #- -fobject-code

# additional options passed to both GHC and GHCi
ghc-options:
  # language extensions to use, recommended by rio
  #     https://github.com/commercialhaskell/rio/#language-extensions
  - -XAutoDeriveTypeable
  # ...
  - -XViewPatterns
```

- in your stack project, run:

```shell
stack build --exec hadui
```

- or run development mode:

```shell
stack build --exec hadui-dev
```

> in development mode, you just refresh the browser page, the
> backend process will be restarted, and changed project source
> get recompiled automatically.

- optionally, customize front UI for your project, by creating a
  `hadui` folder besides your `stack.yaml`.

  take for example:
  https://github.com/complyue/hadui-demo/tree/master/hadui

  - the [Rating.hs module](https://github.com/complyue/hadui-demo/blob/master/demo/src/Rating.hs)
    is paired with [rating.html page](https://github.com/complyue/hadui-demo/blob/master/hadui/rating.html) to use state in frontend only.

  - the [StatefulRating.hs module](https://github.com/complyue/hadui-demo/blob/master/demo/src/StatefulRating.hs)
    is paired with [stateful-rating.html page](https://github.com/complyue/hadui-demo/blob/master/hadui/stateful-rating.html) to use state in backend.
    ![hadui-stateful-rating](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15646573/67364543-55881700-f5a2-11e9-9499-10a488e2c818.png)

  - the [updateRank js method](https://github.com/complyue/hadui-demo/blob/master/hadui/hadui-custom.js#L41) is shared by above 2 examples to update UI from Haskell code.

## VSCode Integration

Setup your [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) with
[HIE](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine)

Create under the project root `.vscode/tasks.json` with following contents:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "presentation": {
    "reveal": "always",
    "panel": "new"
  },
  "tasks": [
    {
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      },
      "label": "hadui-dev",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "cd ${workspaceRoot}; stack build --exec hadui-dev"
    }
  ]
}
```

Press `F7` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+B` (Linux) to start `hadui-dev` for the project
